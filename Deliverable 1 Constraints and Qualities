3.3 Constraints and Qualities

3.3.1 Performance

Lotus is expected to have a rather fast response time; it can take at most 5 seconds by taking into account all the different types of requests available in the system. 

3.3.2 Usability

Lotus will provide a user-friendly environment and will be easily accessible to current web browsers. It will have a user interactive interface that guides the users throughout the process of using the system. It should be a simple and efficient program for students to be able to use without any problems.

3.3.3 Reliability 

As Lotus will be providing real time information, there will be constant updates so the users do not encounter any issues. It will be accessible 24/7 and if at any point the server goes down there will be a backup server that will still allow students to generate schedules. 

3.3.4 Interoperability 

Lotus will require the users to have a basic operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) in order to run the desired web browser (Google Chrome, Firefox, IE, etc.) which will be able to access our web application. 

3.3.5 Scalability

Lotus should be able to support a fairly large amount of simultaneous users and it should run smoothly unless there is an unusual amount of requests overloading the system. Then, a warning message to current users will be prompted to be a little bit patient while the amount of traffic is reduced and the system is back to normal. 

3.3.6 Security

Lotus will only allow access to authenticated users. The passwords will be encrypted and hashed. A session will expire if there is inactivity for about 15 minutes. The system will request the user to log in again to prevent information leaks if he/she tries to return to a previous page.
